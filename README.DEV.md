# DevTest Backend

## Steps
- fix composer config
- fix doctrine config
- reverse engineering
  - php bin/console doctrine:mapping:import "App\Entity" annotation --path=src/Entity
  - checked annotations and relations
- small db privilege fixes
  - web needs access to public and Bundesland
  - uuid generator with left 8 chars leads to unique constraint violation
    - changed to uuid generator for Kunde to Ramsey's version see: [doc](https://github.com/ramsey/uuid-doctrine)
- api specs platform available under (http://localhost:8080/foo)
- added openapi specification under ./tools/openapi.json
- added postman collection and env under ./tools/postman/*

## Small issues
Generally speaking, this was a great experience. I really enjoined working on your dev test. However, I have to mention some small issues I encountered during the development process:
- I had to fix the composer.json file, some dependencies were not matching
- even tho the db was mentioned as not changeable legacy part, I had to tune some privileges to get relations and autogenerated ids working. 
  - In this regard, I had to change the id generator for Kunde to Ramsey's version see: [doc](
- small hiccups while defining the ManyToMany relation between Kunde and Adresse ;)
- I have to admit, that I needed more time than the estimated 3 hours.

## TODO
Due to a very limited availability of time, the following tasks are still open:
- [x] add address & user endpoint for kunde
- [ ] only fetch non soft deleted entities
- [ ] JWT
- [ ] add tests
